"Linux Socket Programming In C++ LG #74","http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue74/tougher.html","Programming","","","Highlight:Sockets are a mechanism for exchanging data between processes. These processes can either be on the same machine, or on different machines connected via a network. Once a socket connection is established, data can be sent in both directions until one of the endpoints closes the connection.

I needed to use sockets for a project I was working on, so I developed and refined a few C++ classes to encapsulate the raw socket API calls. Generally, the application requesting the data is called the client, and the application servicing the request is called the server. I created two primary classes, ClientSocket and ServerSocket, that the client and server could use to exchange data.

The goal of this article is to teach you how to use the ClientSocket and ServerSocket classes in your own applications. We will first briefly discuss client-server communications, and then we will develop a simple example server and client that utilize these two classes.

"LinuxDevCenter.com: Building Unix Tools with Ruby","http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/09/18/ruby_csv.html?page=1","Ruby","","","Highlight:This article demonstrates how to write Ruby scripts that work like typical, well-behaved Unix commands. To make it more fun and useful, we'll write a command-line tool for processing data stored in the comma separated values (CSV) file format. CSV (not CVS) is used to exchange data between databases, spreadsheets, and securities analysis software, as well as between some scientific applications. That format is also used by payment processing sites that provide downloadable sales data to vendors who use their services.

"RoxWiki - Home Page","http://rox.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/HomePage","Unix_Linux","","","Highlight:ROX is a fast, user friendly desktop which makes extensive use of drag-and-drop. The interface revolves around the file manager, or filer, following the traditional Unix view that `everything is a file' rather than trying to hide the filesystem beneath start menus, wizards, or druids. The aim is to make a system that is well designed and clearly presented. The ROX style favours using several small programs together instead of creating all-in-one mega-applications.
